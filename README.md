# Movie Recommendation System
Data Collection: Gather a large dataset of movie-related information, including details like movie titles, genres, release dates, ratings, user reviews, cast and crew information, etc. Datasets like MovieLens, IMDb, or TMDB can be used for this purpose.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and ensuring consistency in the data. This step is crucial for accurate analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset. This involves statistical analysis, visualization, and summarization techniques to understand relationships, trends, distributions, and patterns in the data. EDA helps in understanding user preferences, popular genres, correlations between features, etc.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to extract relevant information. For instance, creating a weighted rating system that considers both the average rating and the number of ratings a movie has received can be beneficial.

Building a Recommendation Model:

Collaborative Filtering: Utilize collaborative filtering techniques such as user-based or item-based collaborative filtering. These methods make recommendations based on similarities between users or items' preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommend movies based on their attributes and features, like genre, cast, director, etc. This method suggests similar items based on the features of the items themselves.
Hybrid Approaches: Combine collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy and coverage.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the recommendation models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for regression models.
